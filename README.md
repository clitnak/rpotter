# Raspberry Potter
Use a wand to control SmartThings

You'll need:
- Raspberry Pi
- Webcam or NoIR Camera
- IR LED Array
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Some sort of IR reflective wand (like the wands you get at Universal Studios)
- Smartthings

create a file named smartthings-token.txt and ensure your token is on the first line. 
Adjust main.py to map spells cast to devices triggered.
